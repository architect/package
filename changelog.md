---

## [8.0.1] 2022-03-01

### Added

- Added `ARC_STACK_NAME` env var to fix missing stack name data; fixes #1322, thanks @Lugana707, @pgte

---

## [8.0.0] 2022-01-13

### Added

- Architect 10 plugin API support!
- Added support for Inventory's `deployStage` property, allowing proper stage awareness to CloudFormation / SAM generation
  - Took over a variety of CloudFormation mutations in Deploy


### Changed

- Breaking change: Package can no longer be run via CLI, and now serves purely as a module generating CloudFormation
- Breaking change: `createFunction` helper exported for the plugins beta is now deprecated in favor of `set.customLambdas`
- Package now populates `ARC_SESSION_TABLE_NAME`, and prefers it to the non-namespaced `SESSION_TABLE_NAME`
  - Both are supported, we suggest using only `ARC_SESSION_TABLE_NAME` moving forward, as all non-namespaced env vars will be retired in a future release
- Breaking change: Package (and thus Architect) no longer automatically populates `NODE_ENV` + `ARC_CLOUDFORMATION` env vars
  - For environment identification needs, Architect now relies solely on `ARC_ENV`
  - Thus, `NODE_ENV` is returned to userland, and is entirely optional
- Stop publishing to the GitHub Package registry
- Migrate static bucket permissions from per-object ACLs to a bucket policy so users can customize the static bucket permissions using plugins
  - See: https://github.com/architect/package/pull/148, https://github.com/architect/deploy/pull/350


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where `@static prefix` + `spa` settings were not getting populated into root handlers other than `get /`
- Fixed issue where using `architect-default-policies` did not include SSM IAM permissions; thanks @tbeseda!

---

## [7.2.0] 2021-11-16

### Added

- Added support for `@tables-streams`, the fully customizable successor to `@tables` with `stream true`
  - Includes support for specifying multiple streams attached to a single table, as well as specifying custom source paths
  - For more see: https://arc.codes/tables-streams
- Added support for `@tables-indexes` (which will eventually supersede `@indexes`)
  - For more see: https://arc.codes/tables-indexes

### Changed

---

## [4.0.1] 2020-10-27

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where API Gateway `HTTP` routes using `any` would not respect using Lambda payload format v1.0 (and would fall back to v2.0 mode)

### Added

- Updated dependencies

---
